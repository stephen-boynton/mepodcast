        "The internet tells us that narcissists are everywhere — and that the problem is only getting worse. It’s like narcissism is oozing out of our celebrities, politicians, partners, parents, maybe even ourselves?? So today, we’re taking a long look in the mirror to find out: are we all a bunch of narcissists? And what should we do if we think someone in our life is a narcissist? We find out by talking to a real narcissist, Lee Hammock of the social media platform “The Self Aware Narcissist” as well as psychologists Prof. W. Keith Campbell, Prof. Kali Trzesniewski, and Dr. Craig Malkin. We want to hear your ideas for new episodes of Science Vs!

        "[VIDEO available on Spotify.] Imagine a vagina. You might be thinking of a passive tube, patiently waiting for a penis to shoot out sperm — and you wouldn't be alone. From Aristotle to Darwin, tons of prominent nerds classified males as the active sexual players: They're coercing, manipulating and harassing to reproduce, while the females are passive, coy, chaste. But animal ecologist Dr. Tiana Pirtle is here to give us the real story.Because once scientists started investigating what really goes on in the vaginas of the animal queendom, they realized that — far from being docile tubes — vaginas are packed with their own weaponry, tools and secret chambers. It turns out that both penises and vaginas were allowed to fight in the evolutionary arms race. Pirtle breaks open a box filled with animal vaginas to tell us all about it.  Find our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsWhenVaginasAttackIn this episode, we cover:(00:00) A Box Full of Vaginas(02:42) The 'Chaste' Female is Born(06:51) The Duck Vagina that Launched a Thousand Ships(11:06) Hyenas and their Pseudo Penises(13:23) Water Striders and their Genital Shields(16:53) Snakes and their Two Vaginas?! (20:28) Alpacas and their Regal Vaginas(25:31) The Rainbow of VaginasThis episode was produced by Wendy Zukerman with help from Michelle Dang, Rose Rimler, Meryl Horn, and Ekedi Fauster-Keeys.

They say that the pill can affect who you’re attracted to, that it can tank your libido, and that it can make you depressed. Instead, some influencers are telling us to try an amazing, hormone-free method — where all you have to do is listen to your body. So … are they right??

As they work toward the Olympics, they face hard choices: take drugs to lower their natural testosterone levels, give up their sport entirely, or fight.

You’ll meet runner Christine Mboma and hear about the difficult choice she faces. Find more episodes of Tested at https://link.chtbl.com/XReiimtOTested is from CBC, NPR’s Embedded, and Bucket of Eels.
