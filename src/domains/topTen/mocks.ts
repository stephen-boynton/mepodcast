        "As Democrats continue to dust themselves off after big losses in 2024, MSNBC’s Jen Psaki examines what’s next for the party. On “The Blueprint with Jen Psaki,” she dives into two crucial questions: where do Democrats stand in this moment? And how can they win again? With a format built for real conversations and necessary pushback, Jen sits down with some of the left’s biggest names to talk about confronting Trump 2.0 and how the party can shape the future they’d like to see. This is a space for edgy, honest discourse where Jen will go beyond political talking points to determine “the blueprint” for what lies ahead.",
